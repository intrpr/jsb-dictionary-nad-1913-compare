# jsb-dictionary-nad-1913-compare
This project is a statistic/visual analysis of comparisons between James Smedley Brown's 1860 Dictionary and the 1913 NAD Preservation Films corpus (http://hsldb.georgetown.edu/sign-index/tokens.php?lex=lex; Supalla, et al. http://hsldb.georgetown.edu/about.php). Unlikely to have any connection, this project should also look at

In Stringham (2019), Brown's work on *Dictionary* is described and triangulated:

> Of course, without other extant contemporary documents and triangulation, it is diffcult to determine
> how accurate Brown was in describing 1860s sign language. Including Brown’s 1856 *Vocabulary*, there are few
> rare published descriptions of *nineteenth-century* American signed language articulation (cf., Mallery,
> 1881; Clark, 1885; Long, 1909, 1918; Supalla, 1992). There is rather enlightening evidence, however, in
> Brown’s description of the AGENT sign (Brown, 1860a, p. vii). American Sign Language employs a lexemic
> suffix that a signer can use to designate the actor of a particular activity (the sign AGENT); this sign
> often functions after the declaration of a verb:
> 
> “thus, by adding this sign to that for the verb serve, we have the sign for servant; to legislate, and 
> we have *legislator*; to benefit, and we have benefactor; to law, and we have *lawyer*; to deceive, and we 
> have, *deceiver*, etc. etc.” (Brown, 1860a, p. vii, italics added)
> 
> Pronunciation of this sign today appears as shown below, but in 1860, Brown described the sign’s 
> articulation and etymology as:
> 
> “the personal sign [AGENT]...is made by placing the palms of the extended hands pointing toward each 
> other 0i N [neck] 0i on the breast, tips of the hands nearly meeting; and thus carrying the hands down 
> the front of the body to 0i W [waist] 0i.  is sign owes its origin to the apron which an artisan wears,
> which covering as it does the front of the person, becomes a sign for the person. (Brown, 1860a, p. vii)
>
> In the 1913 film, “A Lay Sermon: The Universal Brotherhood of Man and Fatherhood of God” produced by the 
> National Association of the Deaf (NAD) as part of its *Preservation* series, Robert P. McGregor provides some
> serendipitous evidence to Brown’s AGENT suffix description. As he questions, in the New Testament, to 
> whom Jesus was indicating should pray to God, McGregor signs FOLLOW + AGENT (“disciples”), and pronounces 
> it **exactly** as Brown elaborates in *Dictionary*.
> 
> Even in the most beloved film of the NAD series, “Preservation of the Sign Language” (1913), as George W. 
> Veditz explains the reason for the love that “friends and fellow deaf-mutes” have for the French icon of 
> deaf education Abbe de L’Epee is because he was their first TEACH + AGENT (“teacher”), pronouncing the 
> lexeme **exactly** as Brown describes it in Dictionary. A review of other like references to AGENT suffixes 
> in the *Preservation* film series provides evidence that Brown’s recorded pronunciation was still present 
> in McGregor, Veditz, and the oratory style of several other contemporaries fifty years after *Dictionary*.
>
> This is significant because comparing and contrasting signs in *Dictionary*, the NAD *Preservation* film 
> series, and modern-day American Sign Language provides rich grounds for research and potential video 
> evidence in observing not only how signed language was pronounced a mere two generations past 
> Hartford but also cataloging how signs have evolved to date (124–125).
